pip install google-cloud-storage


call backedn APis from frontned:
/get_pdf/<filename>

-Update the URLs in your frontend to call the backend APIs for PDF retrieval.


example update for detching PDFs:

# Example AJAX call to fetch a PDF
Example Update for Fetching PDFs:
In your frontend code where you used to access the PDFs locally, update the URLs to point to the new backend endpoint.

def fetch_pdf(filename):
    response = fetch(f'/get_pdf/{filename}')
    if response.ok:
        return response.blob()
    else:
        print('Failed to fetch PDF')


step 4:testing
Ensure Google Cloud Storage Bucket Access:
Verify that the backend can access the PDFs stored in the GCS bucket.

Test Endpoints:
Test the new API endpoints using tools like Postman or directly in the browser to ensure they are working as expected.

Update Frontend:
Make sure the frontend correctly displays or uses the PDFs retrieved from the backend.
